# UM6P Data Management Lab 7 - Parts 3 & 4

## Part 3: Identifying Types of Schedules

**Context:**
* Transaction 1 ($T_1$): R(A), W(A)
* Transaction 2 ($T_2$): R(B), W(B)
* Schedule $S_1$: $R_1(A), R_2(B), W_1(A), W_2(B)$
* Schedule $S_2$: $R_1(A), W_1(A), R_2(B), W_2(B)$

### 1. Are the schedules $S_1$ and $S_2$ equivalent? Justify your answer.

**Answer:** Yes.

**Justification:**
Two schedules are **conflict equivalent** if they have the same operations and the order of all *conflicting* operations is the same.
* $T_1$ reads and writes item **A**.
* $T_2$ reads and writes item **B**.
* Because A and B are different data items, there are **no conflicting operations** between $T_1$ and $T_2$.
* When there are no conflicts, the operations can be swapped freely without changing the result. Therefore, the interleaved schedule $S_1$ is equivalent to the serial schedule $S_2$.

### 2. Is $S_1$ serializable? If yes, give an equivalent serial schedule.

**Answer:** Yes.

**Equivalent Serial Schedule:**
Since there are no conflicts, $S_1$ is equivalent to any serial order of the transactions.
* **Option A:** $T_1 \to T_2$ ($R_1(A), W_1(A), R_2(B), W_2(B)$)
* **Option B:** $T_2 \to T_1$ ($R_2(B), W_2(B), R_1(A), W_1(A)$)

## Part 4: Conflict Serializability

**Context:**
* $T_1$: R(A), W(A)
* $T_2$: W(A), R(B)
* $T_3$: R(A), W(B)
* Schedule $S_3$: $R_1(A), W_2(A), R_3(A), W_1(A), W_3(B), R_2(B)$

### 1. Construct the precedence (dependency) graph for $S_3$

To verify conflict serializability, we look for conflicting operations (Read-Write, Write-Read, Write-Write) on the same data item where the operation in one transaction precedes the other.

**Conflicts identified in Schedule $S_3$:**

1.  **Conflict on A ($R_1$ vs $W_2$):**
    * $R_1(A)$ occurs before $W_2(A)$.
    * **Edge:** $T_1 \to T_2$
2.  **Conflict on A ($W_2$ vs $R_3$):**
    * $W_2(A)$ occurs before $R_3(A)$.
    * **Edge:** $T_2 \to T_3$
3.  **Conflict on A ($W_2$ vs $W_1$):**
    * $W_2(A)$ occurs before $W_1(A)$.
    * **Edge:** $T_2 \to T_1$
4.  **Conflict on A ($R_3$ vs $W_1$):**
    * $R_3(A)$ occurs before $W_1(A)$.
    * **Edge:** $T_3 \to T_1$
5.  **Conflict on B ($W_3$ vs $R_2$):**
    * $W_3(B)$ occurs before $R_2(B)$.
    * **Edge:** $T_3 \to T_2$

**Resulting Precedence Graph (Text Representation):**
* Node $T_1$ has incoming edges from $T_2$ and $T_3$.
* Node $T_2$ has incoming edges from $T_1$ and $T_3$.
* Node $T_3$ has incoming edges from $T_2$.

**Visual Logic:**
* $T_1 \leftrightarrow T_2$ (Double arrow / Cycle)
* $T_2 \leftrightarrow T_3$ (Double arrow / Cycle)

### 2. Is $S_3$ conflict serializable? Justify your answer using the graph.

**Answer:** No.

**Justification:**
A schedule is conflict serializable **if and only if its precedence graph is acyclic** (contains no cycles). The graph for $S_3$ contains multiple cycles, which proves it is not serializable.

**Cycles present in the graph:**
1.  **Cycle 1 ($T_2$ and $T_3$):** We have an edge $T_2 \to T_3$ (due to conflict on A) and an edge $T_3 \to T_2$ (due to conflict on B).
2.  **Cycle 2 ($T_1$ and $T_2$):** We have an edge $T_1 \to T_2$ (due to $R_1$ before $W_2$) and an edge $T_2 \to T_1$ (due to $W_2$ before $W_1$).

Because these cycles exist, there is no valid serial order that respects all dependencies.

## Part 5: 2PL:

This section analyzes the following schedules to determine if they can be generated by a database system enforcing strict 2PL protocol.

**1-Schedule 1**

**Schedule:**
R1(A), W1(A), R1(B), W1(B), R2(A), W2(A)

**Compatible with strict 2PL**: Yes

**Justification:**
T1 acquires locks on A and B during its growing phase and releases them only after completing all operations.
T2 begins only after T1 has finished, so no lock is released before commit.
Both transactions respect the growing and shrinking phases.



**2-Schedule 2**

**Schedule:**
R1(A), W1(A), R2(B), W2(B), R1(B)

**Compatible with strict 2PL**: No

**Justification:**
T1 would need to acquire a lock on B after another transaction (T2) has already written B.
This requires either acquiring a new lock after the shrinking phase has started or releasing a write lock before commit.



**3-Schedule 3**

**Schedule:**
R1(A), W1(A), R1(B), W1(B), R2(C), W2(C)

**Compatible with strict 2PL**: Yes

**Justification:**
T1 and T2 access disjoint data items.
Each transaction acquires all required locks during its growing phase and releases them only after completion.
No lock conflicts occur, and strict 2PL is satisfied.



**4-Schedule 4**

**Schedule:**
R1(A), W1(A), R2(A), W2(A), R1(B), R2(B), W2(B)

**Compatible with strict 2PL:** No

**Justification:**
The interleaving forces a transaction to either release a write lock before commit or acquire new locks after entering the shrinking phase.
This violates the strict separation of growing and shrinking phases required by strict 2PL.
